## About This Project

The Internship Management System, developed using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL, is designed to streamline the management of internship within a company. This system features four distinct user roles: Administrator, Coordinator (University), Supervisor (Company), and Student (Intern).

Adminstrator wield comprehensive control of the system, with the ability to view the entire internship roster. Their responsibilities include validating new intern profiles, allocating tasks and programs, and setting deadlines and statuses. Adminstrator are also empowered to modify or delete these details, as well as adjust the program and status lists. Interns, on the other hand, have limited access, restricted to their personal information. They can update the status of their assigned tasks and edit their personal details. Both Admins and Interns benefit from functionalities like filtering and sorting data.

Furthermore, the flexibility of this application allows it to be repurposed for other similar tasks, such as managing projects or student databases.
